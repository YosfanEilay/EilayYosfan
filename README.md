**`(Threat-Researcher\YouTube-Filmmaker\PowerShell-Developer)`**

A cyber enthusiast since age 14, I'm a passionate Threat Researcher, YouTube filmmaker,
and PowerShell developer. With a black belt in jujitsu, I'm not just equipped to protect
the digital realm but also the physical. My creative flair extends to crafting tools and
scripts for Digital Forensics and Incident Response, fortifying the cyber world against
malicious forces. Join me in preventing cybercriminals from casting their shadow over the internet!
